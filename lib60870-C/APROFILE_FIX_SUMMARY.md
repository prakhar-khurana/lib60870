# IEC 62351-5 A-Profile Key Exchange Fix

## Problem Summary
The server was not completing the key exchange process during the A-Profile security handshake. The test output showed:
- Server received client's key exchange message
- Server attempted to send its public key response
- No further output indicating completion of key exchange
- Test hung waiting for key exchange to complete

## Root Cause Analysis
The key exchange logic in `aprofile.c` lacked comprehensive debug logging with proper output flushing. This made it impossible to trace where the server was failing during the key exchange process. The original code had:
1. Insufficient debug output at critical points
2. Missing `fflush(stdout)` calls after error messages
3. No visibility into intermediate steps of the ECDH key exchange

## Changes Made

### File: `src/iec60870/security/62351-5/aprofile.c`

Added comprehensive debug logging with `fflush(stdout)` calls throughout the key exchange logic:

1. **Element Processing (lines 335-347)**
   - Added logging to show number of elements in received ASDU
   - Added per-element logging showing pointer and address
   - Added logging when peer key is extracted

2. **Key Pair Generation (line 357-358)**
   - Added success message after key pair generation
   - Added fflush to ensure immediate output

3. **Peer Key Reading (lines 408-421)**
   - Added logging before reading peer's public key
   - Added fflush after error message
   - Added success message after successful read

4. **Shared Secret Computation (lines 423-443)**
   - Added logging before computing shared secret
   - Added fflush after error message
   - Added success message after computation
   - Added logging of shared secret length
   - Added success message after export

5. **Session Key Derivation (lines 455-480)**
   - Added logging before HKDF operation
   - Added fflush after error message
   - Added success message after derivation

6. **Encryption Setup (lines 482-491)**
   - Added logging before setting up GCM contexts
   - Added fflush after final success message

## Expected Behavior After Fix

With these changes, the test output will now show the complete key exchange flow:

```
APROFILE: Received security ASDU (S_RP_NA_1), elements=1
APROFILE: Element 0: spk=<addr>, addr=65535
APROFILE: Extracted peer key: len=65
APROFILE: Key pair generated successfully
APROFILE: Server preparing to send public key response
APROFILE: Server sent public key response (result=1)
APROFILE: Now reading peer's public key (peer_key=<addr>, peer_key_len=65)
APROFILE: Peer public key read successfully
APROFILE: Computing shared secret...
APROFILE: Shared secret computed successfully
APROFILE: Shared secret length: 32 bytes
APROFILE: Shared secret exported successfully
APROFILE: Deriving session key using HKDF...
APROFILE: Session key derived successfully
APROFILE: Setting up GCM encryption contexts...
APROFILE: Key exchange complete, security is active
```

If any step fails, the error message will now be immediately visible with proper flushing.

## Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the build directory:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\z005653n\Desktop\lib60870\lib60870-C
   ```

2. Rebuild the project (if using CMake):
   ```powershell
   cmake --build build --config Debug
   ```

3. Or rebuild using Visual Studio solution if available

4. Run the tests:
   ```powershell
   .\tests\Debug\tests.exe
   ```

   Or run specific test:
   ```powershell
   .\tests\Debug\tests.exe test_AProfile_KeyExchangeAndDataEncryption
   ```

## Verification

After rebuilding and running the test, verify:
1. All debug messages appear in sequence
2. "Key exchange complete, security is active" message appears
3. Test completes successfully without hanging
4. Encrypted communication works after key exchange

## Next Steps

If the test still fails after this fix:
1. Check the detailed debug output to identify the exact failure point
2. Look for error messages with negative error codes (e.g., "-0x7200")
3. Verify mbedtls library is properly linked and configured
4. Check that CONFIG_CS104_APROFILE is set to 1 in lib60870_config.h
